Chapter 1 Introducing Bedework 3.6

Bedework System Overview
Bedework is an open-source enterprise calendar system that supports public, personal, and
group calendaring. It is designed to conform to current calendaring standards with a goal of
attaining strong interoperability between other calendaring systems and clients. Bedework is
built with an emphasis on higher education, though it is used by many commercial
enterprises.
You may choose to deploy Bedework for public events calendaring, personal calendaring and
scheduling, or both. Bedework is suitable for embedding in other applications or in portals
and has been deployed across a wide range of environments.
