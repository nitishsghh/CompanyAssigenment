The Bedework system is divided into two main spaces: the public events space, and the
personal and group calendaring space which are kept separate by design. Public events are
stored below a public calendar root folder and personal calendars are below a user calendar
root folder.
PUBLIC PERSONAL & GROUP
EVENTS EVENTS
calendars & events are calendars & events are
publicly viewable unless private unless shared
hidden or access is changed 
root is /public root is /user
Personal calendar users (and other clients) can subscribe to public events, but users may only
add public events using the Administrative and Community Submissions web clients. For
more information about Bedework's public and personal event calendaring models, see
chapters 4 and 5.
